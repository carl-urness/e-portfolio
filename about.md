My name is Carl Urness.  This site has been built as part of a graduation requirement to complete a master's degree at Dominican University.  Components of my ePortfolio include:

- Table of Contents
- Current Resume
- A Reflective Essay
- Evidence or Artifacts (Items that demonstrate my competencies in relation to the program's five learning goals)

The program I completed is the School of Information Studies:  Master's of Science in Information Management.

Here is a link to the program's site: [Dominican University](https://www.dom.edu/admission/graduate/information-studies-programs/msim)
