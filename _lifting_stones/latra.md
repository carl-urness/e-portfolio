Another famous set of lifting stones in the Westfjords are the Latra Stones, located near some of Icelandâ€™s famous seabird cliffs. Many generations of local fishermen used these stones to stay fit and gain bragging rights in their rare time on dry land. Like the Dritvik Stones, there is a hierarchy of stones based on their size, and a system in place for challenging the lifter.
