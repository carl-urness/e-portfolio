Located in the "vik" or cove known as Látravík, the Judas Stone is particular infamous among the many lifting stones in the Westfjords. It supposedly earned its name more than a century ago, when local farmers repeatedly attempted to utilize it in the construction of a wall, only to have it "betray" them like Judas by always slipping out of place.
