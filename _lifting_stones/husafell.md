The most famous of Iceland's legendary lifting stones is named for the west country farming estate on which it resides; a familiar destination for strongmen across the decades. The Húsafell Stone is said to have been crafted from a large rock over 200 years ago, when a local pastor named Snorri Björnsson adopted it as the door to his goat pen. Once passing travelers started using the stone as a test of strength, Snorri gave it a nickname: Kviahellan, or "the pen slab."
