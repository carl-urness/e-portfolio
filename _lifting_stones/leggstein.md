The “Leggstein” or “Tomb Stone” isn’t just named after its appearance. Weighing 220 kg, or 480 LBS, this pillar-like stone, located in the northwestern corner of Iceland, is said to mark the spot where an unfortunate farmer made a pact with the devil. As the story goes, the lazy farmer wanted a fast track to an easier, more prosperous life, so the devil offered him his dream if he could simply complete one task: lifting the Leggstein stone.
