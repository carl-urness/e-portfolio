Legend says that the Brynjólfstak Stone was first pulled from the sea in 1845, when a mighty farmer named Brynjólfur asked four of the strongest men in the land to lift the giant slab on to his shoulders. From there, as perhaps an extreme proof of his own superior strength, Brynjólfur carried the 281kg (620 LB) stone on his own, uphill, to a nearby ridge . . . a distance of 50-70 meters to its current location. Naturally, the stone has since been named in his honor.
